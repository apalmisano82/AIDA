# AIDA (Archive of Italian radiocarbon DAtes)

#### Alessio Palmisano, Andrew Bevan, Dan Lawrence & Stephen Shennan 

The archive AIDA provides a collation of 4,010 radiocarbon dates from 947 archaeological sites in Italy  (mainland, including Sicily and Sardinia) spanning from 11,000 to 1500 uncal. yr. BP . These dates have been collected from existing online digital archives, and electronic and print original publications.

The plot below show the Summed Probability Distribution (SPD) generated by using all the calibrated radiocarbon dates (in grey, n=4,010) and those ones from short-lived organic samples (in green, n=1,057).

There are several caveats related to the present dataset as the original radiocarbon dates had an inhomogeneous quality of associated information which reflect the diversity of standards in the original sources. For instance, 77% of the dates have information about the sample material (e.g., seed, bone), but only 26% have the material taxa (e.g., Triticum dicoccum, Ovis, etc.).  


## Main Dataset AIDA

The main dataset is to be found within /Palmisano_etal_data_and_code/csv/dates.csv. The csv-file is encoded in ‘UTF-8’. The geographic coordinates are stored as unprojected LatLon coordinate system, WGS84 datum.

#### Location Quality Key

A – exact coordinates of radiocarbon sample (centroid of the archaeological site from which was collected)

B- the radiocarbon sample is within a 2km radius’ buffer of the coordinates collected

C -the radiocarbon sample is within a 5km radius’ buffer of the coordinates collected

D- the radiocarbon sample is within a 10 km radius’ buffer of the coordinates collected

E- the radiocarbon sample is within a 20 km radius’ buffer of the coordinates collected
