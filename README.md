The archive AIDA provides a collation of 4,010 radiocarbon dates from 947 archaeological sites in Italy  (mainland, including Sicily and Sardinia) spanning from 11,000 to 1500 uncal. yr. BP . These dates have been collected from existing online digital archives, and electronic and print original publications.
